## Cloud Computing Basics.

# What is the Client-Server Model?
    - The Client-Server model is about a client that interacts and makes requests to a computer server.
    - The server does tasks for the client and returns information.

A client is the way that the person interact with the server.
    - There are 3 different kind of deployment models.
    1. Cloud-based.
    2. On-premises.
    3. Hybrid.

# The models are different ways of accessing computing services: on internet, locally, in a combination.

1. Cloud-based Deploymet - 
    * Everything runs in the cloud.
    * the model allows you to build new applications or move existing ones to the cloud.
    * the level of service has different requirements on your managment, architecturing and infrastructure.
    * example - a company might create an application consisting of virtual machines, databases, networking componenets entirely based in the cloud.

2. On-premise Deploymet - 
    * Deploy resources using virtulization and resource managment tools.
    * On-prem Dep also known as Private Cloud Deployment.
    example - you use a application that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center.
    * though this model is like legacy IT infrastructure, its applicaiton managment and virtulization technologies make it more effective.

3. Hybrid deployment - 
    * In a hybrid deployement, you connect cloud resources to an on-premises infrastructure.
    This approach is relevant in many situations.
    exmaple - you are working with sensitive data or are under specific government regulations.
