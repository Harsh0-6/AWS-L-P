## Cloud Computing Basics.

# What is the Client-Server Model?
    - The Client-Server model is about a client that interacts and makes requests to a computer server.
    - The server does tasks for the client and returns information.
    - ![alt text](image.png) (cli-server arch img).

A client is the way that the person interact with the server.
    - There are 3 different kind of deployment models.
    1. Cloud-based.
    2. On-premises.
    3. Hybrid.

# The models are different ways of accessing computing services: on internet, locally, in a combination.

1. Cloud-based Deploymet - 
    * Everything runs in the cloud.
    * the model allows you to build new applications or move existing ones to the cloud.
    * the level of service has different requirements on your managment, architecturing and infrastructure.
    * example - a company might create an application consisting of virtual machines, databases, networking componenets entirely based in the cloud.

2. On-premise Deploymet - 
    * Deploy resources using virtulization and resource managment tools.
    * On-prem Dep also known as Private Cloud Deployment.
    example - you use a application that run on technology that is fully kept in your on-premises data center.
    * though this model is like legacy IT infrastructure, its applicaiton managment and virtulization technologies make it more effective.

3. Hybrid deployment - 
    * In a hybrid deployement, you connect cloud resources to an on-premises infrastructure.
    This approach is relevant in many situations.
    exmaple - you are working with sensitive data or are under specific government regulations.

# Why Cloud Computing?
    - benefits: 1. Cost savings: Pay as you go.
                2. Security.
                3. Scalablity.
                4. Flexiblity.

## AWS Cloud EC2.
    - EC2 is a virtual in the AWS cloud.
    - AWS EC2 is short for AWS Elastic Cloud Compute.
    - It makes scaling of capacity up and down easy.

    - get started with EC2 in three steps.
    1. Launch: ~ Start with selecting a template with basic configurations.
               ~ The config includes the operating system, application server, or applications.
               ~ decide the instance type and hardware configuration of your instance.
               ~ specify the security settings to control the traffic in and out of your instance.

    2. Connect: ~ There are many ways to connect to instance.
                1. Programs and applications have multiple connection method to exchange data.
                2. Users can connect and access the computer dekstop by loggin in.

    3. Use: ~ Once connected, use it.
            ~ Execute commands to install software, add storage, copy, and organize files, and much more.

# AWS EC2 Instances types:
    - There are different instances types:
    - when selecting an instance type, consider the needs:
        needs can be a requirement for compute, memory, or storage.

    # General Purpose Instance.
        GPI balances computing, memory, and networking resources.
        It fits many purposes such as:
            ~ Application servers.
            ~ Gaming servers.
            ~ Backend servers for companies.
            ~ Small and medium database.
            * GPI are best when there is balance between the resources.

    # Compute Optimized Resources.
        Best when 'high compute' is required.
        This type is also good for application servers, gaming server, and web apps.
        The main difference is that 'this type is ideal for high-performance and compute-intensive tools.
        
    # Memory Optimized Resources.
        this type can deliver large dataset workloads fast.
        ~ Memory is a temporary storage area.
        ~ It loads from storage, holds the data, and process it before the computer can run it.
        ~ The processing allows for a preloading process and gives the CPU direct access to the computer program.
        ~ MPI are best when huge amounts of data need to be preloaded before running the app.

    # Accelerated Computing Instances.
        this type use hardware accelators.
        ~ the accelators boost the data processing.
        ~ the ACI is best for graphics apps and streaming.
        
    # Storage Optimized Instances.
        this is best when you have large datasets on local storage.
        ~ Large file system.
        ~ Data Warehouses.
        ~ Online transaction systems.
        SOI is designed to deliver many inputs as fast as possible.

    # AWS EC2 Pricing.
        With AWS EC2 you pay for the compute time.
        You only pay for the compute time that you see.
